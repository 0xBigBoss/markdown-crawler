# Overview
This is a multithreaded web crawler that crawls a website and creates markdown files for each page.
It was primarily created for large language model document parsing to simplify chunking and processing of large documents for RAG use cases.
Markdown by nature is human readable and maintains document structure while keeping a small footprint.

### Features include
- üßµ Threading support for faster crawling
- ‚è¨ Set the max depth of children you wish to crawl
- ‚úÖ Validates URLs, HTML, filepaths
- üç≤ Uses BeautifulSoup to parse HTML
- ü™µ Verbose logging option
- üë©‚Äçüíª Ready-to-go CLI interface

# Quick start

If you wish to simply use it in the CLI, you can run the following command:
```
pip install md_crawler
md_crawler -n 5 -d 3 -b ./markdown https://platform.openai.com/docs/introduction
```

From the github repo once you have it checked out:
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
python3 md_crawler.py -n 5 -d 3 -b ./markdown https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morty_Smith
```

Or use the library in your own code:
```
from md_crawler import md_crawl
url = 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morty_Smith'
md_crawl(url, max_depth=3, num_threads=5, base_path='markdown')
```
